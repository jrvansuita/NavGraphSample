# Words App (Jetpack NavGraph)

This folder contains the source code for the Words app.

# Introduction

Words app allows you to select a letter and use Intents to navigate to an Activity that presents a
number of words starting with that letter. Each word can be looked up via a web search.

Words app contains a scrollable list of 26 letters A to Z in a RecyclerView. The orientation of the
RecyclerView can be changed between a vertical list or a grid of items.

The app demonstrates the new use of Fragments: to navigate inside an app with the new Jectpack NavGraph component
